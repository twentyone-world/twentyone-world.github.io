The following is a rough blueprint for starting a local "twentyone" community, or what we call a [fork](/fork). This has worked in multiple countries.

It might help to watch the last [10 minutes of this video](https://youtu.be/iOWvL9-4k4A?t=982), which explains the blueprint in more detail.
We explicitely encourage you to learn from our experience and adopt the [concept](/concept).

## Team Up

{% include image.html name="handshake.svg" float="right" %}

Step zero is to **[find another bitcoiner](/secrets)**. It is way easier and way more fun. Don’t
try to do everything on your own, so let me repeat this once more: find another
bitcoiner and team up.

It should be someone you like, someone that speaks the same language. Once you
are two, you can get rolling.

## Create a Beacon

Step one: **[create a beacon in cyberspace](/beacon)**. Something that is easy to find and easy
to consume. Something that other bitcoiners can rally around. Something with low
noise and high signal.

{% include image.html name="beacon.svg" %}
A weekly or bi-weekly [podcast] is perfect in terms of scalability. It isn’t that
much work to produce, and it is something that can be easily found, easily
consumed, and scales almost indefinitely. Other formats, such as a newsletter,
probably work well too. But it’s hard to beat the in-person character of a
podcast. You are two now, so it should be easy to just shoot the shit or discuss
the news for an hour every week. Feel free to [fork the logo][logo] and the [name], in
case you want to stick with the twentyone theme.

## Provide a Space

{% include image.html name="space.svg" float="right" %}

With the beacon in place, **[provide a space](/space) so that other bitcoiners can join in**.
A public group chat works well. Telegram, Matrix, IRC, Discord—what tool you use
is probably not too important. What is important is to have a solid group of
people in place: bitcoin plebs that are in it for the revolution, not for the
money or to shill the next shitcoin project. Your own little community. Local
and localized, but globally connected.

Be welcoming but vigilant, and always remember that everyone is a scammer.

## Your Language. Your Culture

{% include image.html name="translation.svg" %}

There is no shortage of great educational content. Unfortunately, most of it is
in English. The importance of localized educational material can’t be
overstated.

**Start an effort to translate the best content** into your local
language. Remember to involve the community. You’d be surprised how many people
would love to get involved and help with translations.

Here is a [list of articles][translations] to get you started.

## Consistency, Consistency, Consistency
{% include image.html name="consistency.svg" float="right" %}

Consistency is key. Your beacon should provide a steady signal for yourself and
others. It will be hard at first, but if you and your friend have been in
bitcoin for a while it should be trivial to talk about current events and/or how
bitcoin works for an hour every week.

**Stick with it for at least [21 weeks](/secrets).** All you need is some patience and
consistency, and the rest will happen on its own.
